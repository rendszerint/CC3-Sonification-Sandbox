# CC3-Sonification-Sandbox
Max &amp; Wekinator exercise

### Idea
Self-soothing gestures sonified (almost) into a hungarian nursing rhyme. 

### How to Use
1. Download everything
2. Open & run Weki (use default ports)
3. Open Max, choose a synth from the presets.

### Gestures - LEFT HAND
1. Caress your right cheek with your left hand, as if it belonged to a loved one.
2. Hold your right earlobe with your left hand, as if you were trying to cool your fingers down after checking the boiling milk's temperature with hand. (A friend said it works)
3. Put your left hand on your right shoulder - it's okay, everything is going to be all right. You are not alone.
